//You are given an integer array nums. We call a subset of nums good if its 
//product can be represented as a product of one or more distinct prime numbers. 
//
// 
// For example, if nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]:
//
// 
// [2, 3], [1, 2, 3], and [1, 3] are good subsets with products 6 = 2*3, 6 = 2*3
//, and 3 = 3 respectively. 
// [1, 4] and [4] are not good subsets with products 4 = 2*2 and 4 = 2*2 
//respectively. 
// 
// 
// 
//
// Return the number of different good subsets in nums modulo 10‚Åπ + 7. 
//
// A subset of nums is any array that can be obtained by deleting some (
//possibly none or all) elements from nums. Two subsets are different if and only if the 
//chosen indices to delete are different. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
//Output: 6
//Explanation: The good subsets are:
//- [1,2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
//- [1,2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
//- [1,3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
//- [2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
//- [2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
//- [3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: nums = [4,2,3,15]
//Output: 5
//Explanation: The good subsets are:
//- [2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
//- [2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
//- [2,15]: product is 30, which is the product of distinct primes 2, 3, and 5.
//- [3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
//- [15]: product is 15, which is the product of distinct primes 3 and 5.
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// 1 <= nums.length <= 10‚Åµ 
// 1 <= nums[i] <= 30 
//
